The Raspberry Turk is a robot that can play chess. It is completely open source and the methods for building it are documented on this website. The project is written almost entirely in Python, and runs on a Raspberry Pi.

The project consists of several main components working together:

1. The Raspberry Pi, running all of the code
2. The robotic arm, for moving the pieces
3. The camera and lighting fixture
4. The table itself, which hold the board/pieces, the arm, and the pipe supporting the lights and camera.
