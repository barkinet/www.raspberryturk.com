# Introduction
---

The Raspberry Turk is built into a small 3 ft by 3 ft table. It has a box which is fastened to one side and houses all of the electronics. The [arm](/details/arm.html) is attached to the top of the box. There is a tall vertical pipe fastened to the box that supports a fixture with the camera and lighting directly above the board. The pipe is [black steel plumbing pipe](http://www.homedepot.com/b/Plumbing-Pipes-Fittings-Black-Pipe-Fittings/N-5yc1vZbqn5) from Home Depot.

# Camera
---

The camera is attached by a HDMI cable running through the pipe. I took the model for Raspberry Pi camera case found [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:792444), and adapted it so that the backplate could be fastened to the bottom of the wooden fixture. The model for the adapted backplate can be found [here](https://tinkercad.com/things/4wXPT8hs05X).

# Lights

The fixture also hold three 3 [Phillips 5000K PAR38 flood lights](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Philips-100W-Equivalent-Daylight-5000K-PAR38-Dimmable-LED-Flood-Light-Bulb-435016/205213868) used to light the chessboard evenly with bright white light. Using high temperature lighting ensured colors remained accurate which is import for the [computer vision algorithms](/details/vision.html).

# Chessboard

The chessboard is painted onto the table using [FrogTape](https://www.amazon.com/FrogTape-1358463-Multi-Surface-Painting-0-94-Inch/dp/B002Z8HB2A) and matte black & white spray paint.
