# Introduction
---

At the moment the AI backend to the Raspberry Turk is [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org)–considered the strongest open source chess engine in the world. It is allowed one second to think about its move–so yes, it will almost certainly beat you.

# Future Plans
---

Eventually I would like to build my own chess engine for the project, when I have more time.
